## Collaboration

Code contributions from collaborators are not expected, and they should be discussed ahead of time. Should a collaborator wish to contribute code, they agree to follow the workflow guidelines below.

The development of this repository follows the [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow):

* There is **one remote repository** -- no forks.
* Contributors must clone the remote repository to a local one. I suggest [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for managing your local repository (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) for documentation).
* The **main branch** is viewed as the most current "deployable" version -- it represents the best working version of the project at the time.
* All work is done in **feature branches** off of the main branch
  * **NEVER** commit/push directly to the main branch. This will prevent merge conflicts.
* **Pull requests** are submitted and reviewed prior to merging changes into the main branch. 
* Commits should be small (one change at a time) and have a useful commit message
* Pull requests should have one or more issues linked to them, and should not try to solve too many problems at once
