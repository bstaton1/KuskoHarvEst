# Workflow Description {-}

This section describes the steps carried out by the analyst to produce harvest and effort estimates using the 'KuskoHarvEst' package -- Figure \@ref(fig:fig1) shows a visual schematic.
The 'KuskoHarvEst' workflow begins following the conclusion of a subsistence harvest opportunity in which both on-the-ground interviews and aerial surveys were conducted.

1. The analyst must **compile all data** that were gathered during the opportunity -- great care must be taken during this step since, by design, errors in raw data entry or formatting are the source of any issues the analyst may encounter later in the workflow (complete details on data file formatting can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bstaton1/KuskoHarvEst/blob/main/inst/rstudio/templates/project/resources/04-documentation/01-raw-data.html)).
After the data have been compiled, the analyst creates a new folder on their computer (aided by 'KuskoHarvEst') to serve as the location where the software will automatically look for and export necessary files -- the analyst must place the data files in this location manually.

2. The analyst next must access the **"Meta-Data Tool"**, which is a simple interactive interface (see [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bstaton1/KuskoHarvEst/blob/main/inst/rstudio/templates/project/resources/04-documentation/02-meta-data-tool.html) for visuals and instructions) where users enter information relevant to the fishing day such as the dates, times, and area coverage of the estimates, web links to the announcement of the fishing opportunity, contact information for the analyst(s), and which types of fishing gear were allowed (i.e., set net only versus set and drift nets).
Because of the interface design, it is impossible for users to incorrectly format their selections here, which is critical since many of the calculations in later steps depend on the information entered in this step.
As such, this step creates a new file that stores the entries made by the user ("Meta-Data File"; Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)).

3. The analyst next must access the **"Interview/Flight Data Tool"**, which is a more complex, yet still intuitive, interactive interface (see [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bstaton1/KuskoHarvEst/blob/main/inst/rstudio/templates/project/resources/04-documentation/03-interview-flight-data-tool.html) for visuals and instructions).
Here, the user selects which files to include, sets input values for data screening rules (pre-populated with default values that are recommended to never change), loads the data which are automatically screened for issues, and views the outcomes of these data preparation steps: a compiled data set of all interviews that were conducted.
Please see [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bstaton1/KuskoHarvEst/blob/main/inst/rstudio/templates/project/resources/04-documentation/06-data-checks.html) for a complete description of all automated data checks made by the software.
As part of this step, the user also instructs the software to prepare the flight data into a standardized format.
If there are any data formatting errors, the program would crash at this point and the analyst would need to exit the interface and correct them before proceeding.

4. The next and final step for the analyst is to access the **"Report Builder Tool"**, where they select which content to include in the output report (via check boxes), build the "Rmarkdown file" (with the click of a button; more details below), and render the main PDF document (with the click of another button; see [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/bstaton1/KuskoHarvEst/blob/main/inst/rstudio/templates/project/resources/04-documentation/04-report-builder-tool.html) for visuals and instructions).
This PDF is the file that is distributed to other biologists, managers, and stakeholders that displays data summaries and estimates -- see Figures \@ref(fig:est1) - \@ref(fig:est4) for examples of the pages of this document.
Users also perform these tasks to produce the sensitivity analyses PDF document through this same tool, which can give useful insights on the reliability of the estimates (see Figures \@ref(fig:sen1) -- \@ref(fig:sen3) for examples of the pages of this document).
Also created in this step is the "Bootstrap File", which contains the harvest estimates and their uncertainty and is useful in calculating uncertainty in cumulative harvest estimates.
