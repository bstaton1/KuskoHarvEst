# Harvest Sensitivity Analyses {-}

::: {.small data-latex=""}
_This analysis leaves out one interview data source at a time and recalculates the harvest estimates for all species and gears. The effort estimate still uses all data. This gives information about how much each data source contributes to the overall estimates, and how different the estimates would have been had a data source not been collected. The "Estimate" column shows the mean estimate and 95% confidence interval in parentheses, the "% Change" column gives a measure of change relative to the mean estimate using all data, and the "CV" column is the coefficient of variation of the estimate -- this is a measure of uncertainty (higher values mean more uncertainty). **Set nets were excluded from the harvest estimates because the data were deemed insufficient to produce a reliable estimate**._
