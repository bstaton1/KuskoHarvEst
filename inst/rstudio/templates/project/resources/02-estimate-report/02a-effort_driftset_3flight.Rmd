* An estimated **`r drift_effort_info$effort_est_total`** total drift boat trips occurred.
  * An estimated **`r percentize(drift_effort_info$p_T1_given_T2[1])`** of the trips counted on flight 2 were also counted on flight 1.
  * An estimated **`r percentize(drift_effort_info$p_T1_given_T2[2])`** of the trips counted on flight 3 were also counted on flight 2.
  * An estimated **`r drift_effort_info$effort_not_count`** trips were not counted during any flights.
* An estimated **`r set_effort_info$effort_est_total`** total set net trips occurred.
