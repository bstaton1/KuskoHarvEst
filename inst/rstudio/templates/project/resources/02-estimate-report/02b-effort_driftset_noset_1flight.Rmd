* An estimated **`r drift_effort_info$effort_est_total`** total drift boat trips occurred.
  * Since only one flight was conducted, the counts did not need to be corrected for double counts.
  * An estimated **`r drift_effort_info$effort_not_count`** trips were not counted during any flights.
* An estimated **`r set_effort_info$effort_est_total`** total set net trips occurred, but no harvest estimate was made.
