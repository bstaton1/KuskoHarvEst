Description: This package contains two main types of functionality to facilitate harvest and effort estimation.
    First, there are "core" functions that handle data processing and estimation tasks. However, many potential users
    of this package are not R programmers, and so the second type of functionality is to enable interactive and automated
    creation of estimates and reports. The intent is to place the emphasis of the analyst on the raw data files
    rather than on the intricacies of estimation and automated reporting.
